# iFileTweak
a feature created in tweak ( and i won't release it ) but i hope to see it in iFile's updates.

[ i need a feature within iFile ( to refresh Files once the application become Active ) -> i'm tired to scroll up everytime i need to refresh the table ].
[ i need it because if i'm sending big file from the computer, and left iFile app, to use another one and get back to iFile after while, it force me to refresh the table to see my new file ].

Hope you understand :P
